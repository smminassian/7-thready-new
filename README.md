This is forky thready part 2. I am working on a another repo right now. The problem is that it is forked and it is private and I cant change visibility. Now i just got to see why it only prints 1 and 2. Before I had it where it was printing all of them. Its just the TID was wrong which was an issue. So i changed it by doing create create create and join join join. However, it caused other issues to come up. I will submit what I have.
